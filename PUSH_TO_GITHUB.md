## üí° Recommended: METHOD 1 (GitHub Desktop)

It's the fastest and doesn't require tokens or terminal commands.

## ‚ùì Need Help?

If something doesn't work, the issue is authentication. GitHub needs to verify it's you before accepting the upload.

The **GitHub Desktop** method handles all authentication automatically through its built-in browser login!
