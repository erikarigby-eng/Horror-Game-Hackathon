## Death Endings

### Instant Death Scenarios:

2. **INSTANT_DEATH_2** - The Paw's Hunger (trying to destroy the paw)
3. **INSTANT_DEATH_3** - Defying Fate (challenging the paw directly)
4. **INSTANT_DEATH_4** - Blood Price (Herbert returns wrong)
5. **INSTANT_DEATH_5** - Cursed Knowledge (understanding the paw's nature)

### Regular Death Endings (E1-E11):
- E1-E11: Various horror endings that also result in death

## Difficulty Balance

### Challenge Level:
- **Mini-games every 2 questions** = ~15-20 mini-games in a full playthrough
- **3 lives** = Can fail 2 mini-games and survive
- **Life restoration** = Every 10 questions gives breathing room
- **Instant deaths** = 4+ dangerous choices that end the game immediately

### Expected Death Rate:
- Casual players: 40-50% death rate
- First-time players: 60-70% death rate
- Experienced players: 20-30% death rate

## Tips for Survival:
1. Be careful with mini-games - they appear frequently
2. Avoid obviously dangerous wishes (unlimited wishes, challenging the paw)
3. Save lives for later in the game when mini-games get harder
4. Learn mini-game patterns to improve success rate
5. Every 10 questions = 1 life restored, so keep going!
